# PriorityQueue
Priority queue writen in java.

This is another project from csci 232. This priority queue is by default min-heap and the poll() method returns its values in ascending order, but the order can be changed to anything the user wants by changing the comparison method. Debugging.java was used for testing, and currently contains a basic demo.  
Compile: javac Debugging.java  
Run:     java Debugging
